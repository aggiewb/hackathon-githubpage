        <h1>What is a Hackathon?</h1>
        <p>A hack is a way to cut with rough or heavy blows. In this same sense, a hackathon involves <br> finding a rough solution to an idea over a short period of time. The lack of perfection helps <br> people experiment with ideas and tools they might not have otherwise in a more restricted environment.
        </p>
        <p>During the event, people come together to problem-solve or work on a particular task. <br> They typically often involve computers; however, programming is not necessary to participate since <br> they involve people in various different areas of expertise in a team to solve a problem. 
        </p>
        <p>Some hackathons are competitive in nature and involve prize money or job offers. <br> Others are for charity and help non-profit and not-for-profit groups achieve a goal involving a social issue. <br> They can even be coordinated by a group of friends to build a tool around personal interests! 
        </p>

        <p>Hackathons generally last anywhere from from a night to a weekend. <br>
